### About
Welcome to my personal website! I am Soumyajit Ghosh, a 
passionate and dedicated PhD student pursuing my doctoral 
studies in the field of computational mechanics 
at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. 
My journey in the world of academia has been a 
fascinating and enriching one. 
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering 
and an institute gold medallist in Master's degree in Structural Engineering. 
Further, I have worked as a planning engineer; 
the real-life scenarios of structural and material failures 
have motivated and increased my curiosity and prepared 
me for the challenges of advanced research. 
My academic journey has always been driven by a deep-seated 
fascination for fracture in engineering materials and structural components; 
moreover, I am committed to making meaningful contributions to this field. 
My current research focuses on a thermodynamically consistent 
phase field model for predicting fracture of brittle materials. 
However, for model implementation, I utilize the Gridap package in Julia. 
In addition to my research, I have a strong passion for teaching and gathering knowledge. 
Furthermore, I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of applied mechanics 
and I am open to research collaborationsâ€”feel free to reach out!
