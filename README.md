Welcome to my personal website! I am Soumyajit Ghosh, a 
passionate and dedicated PhD student pursuing my doctoral 
studies in the field of computational mechanics 
at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. 
My journey in the world of academia has been a 
fascinating and enriching one. 
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering 
and an institute gold medallist in Master's degree in Structural Engineering. 
Further, I have worked as a planning engineer; 
the real-life scenarios of structural and material failures 
have motivated and increased my curiosity and prepared 
me for the challenges of advanced research. 
My academic journey has always been driven by a deep-seated 
fascination for fracture in engineering materials and structural components; 
moreover, I am committed to making meaningful contributions to this field. 
My current research focuses on a thermodynamically consistent 
phase field model for predicting fracture of brittle materials. 
However, for model implementation, I utilize the Gridap package in Julia. 
In addition to my research, I have a strong passion for teaching and gathering knowledge. 
Furthermore, I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of applied mechanics 
and I am open to research collaborationsâ€”feel free to reach out!

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project administrators, either 
[Santiago Badia](mailto:santiago.badia@monash.edu) or 
[Francesc Verdugo](mailto:f.verdugo.rojano@vu.nl). All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
